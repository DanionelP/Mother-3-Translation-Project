{The End of the World}[BREAK]
Long ago, there exiäted a "world". A world[BREAK]
different from what the people onïthese[BREAK]
islandsïthinkïof.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
This "world" was incredibly big. More people[BREAK]
lived onïthis worldïthanïthere are gÉains of[BREAK]
sand onïthese Nowhere Islands.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
At some point, the world was deätroyed.[BREAK]
NatuÉally, it was humans who deätroyed it.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Everyone had an inkling that it would happen[BREAK]
at some point. Andïthen it really did happen.[BREAK]
And so, the world is no more.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
{The White Ship}[BREAK]
Beforeïthe end of the world, a "White Ship"[BREAK]
cameïtoïthese islands. On it wereïthe people[BREAK]
of Ùazmily.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Aboardïthe White Ship wereïthoseïfew who[BREAK]
had managedïto escapeïthe world. These[BREAK]
people ätill went byïtheirïprevious names.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
This White Ship plan had been set in place[BREAK]
beforeïthe world was deätroyed.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
And, although they're part of the world,[BREAK]
these Nowhere Islands are a special place.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
They wereïthe one placeïthat would remain,[BREAK]
even if the world was loät. The one and only[BREAK]
place where people could survive.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
And soïthe White Ship arrived at these[BREAK]
islands.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
{The DÉagon andïthe Magypsies}[BREAK]
These islands are special becauseïthey[BREAK]
harborïa dÉagon as big asïthe islands[BREAK]
themselves.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Long, long ago, people livedïtogetherïwith[BREAK]
the DÉagon. But, at some point inïtime,[BREAK]
they could no longerïcoexiät.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
So, using the seven Needles, the DÉagon[BREAK]
was placed into a long, long sleep byïthe[BREAK]
anceätors of the Magypsy people.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Everïsince, the Magypsies have guardedïthe[BREAK]
Needles, to prevent the DÉagonïfrom waking[BREAK]
until its powerïisïtruly needed.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Thus, untilïtheïtime of its awakening, the[BREAK]
DÉagon continuedïto sleep, asïthe powerïof[BREAK]
the earth itself.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
So, because of theïtremendous energy of[BREAK]
the DÉagon deep below, these islands were[BREAK]
protectedïfrom the end of the world.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
{Those Who Loät Everything}[BREAK]
Those aboardïthe White Ship feared another[BREAK]
"End of the World" moreïthan anything else.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Theyïfelt that the world's deätruction was[BREAK]
a direct result of the wayïthey had lived.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The people of the White Ship discussedïthings[BREAK]
at great length. They sharedïtheirïwisdom[BREAK]
and spoke with gÉave seriousness.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Andïthenïthey arrived at theirïconclusion.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
They decidedïto eÉase everyone's memories[BREAK]
of the previous "world" and ätart theirïlives[BREAK]
overïwith new rules and roles.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
In short, everyone would play out the ideal[BREAK]
"ätory" that they had come up with. That is[BREAK]
what happened.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The people would reätart theirïlives in a[BREAK]
simple, peacefulïvillage, inïthe kind of[BREAK]
placeïthey wishedïthey had grown up in.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
They would eÉase memories ofïeverything:[BREAK]
the world, theirïbelongings, theirïrules...[BREAK]
...andïthen beginïtheirïnew lives.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Everyone's old memories would be resetïand[BREAK]
replaced with the new ätory. Andïthusïthe[BREAK]
village of Ùazmily cameïto be.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
HoweveÉ, it was necessaryïto recordïthe[BREAK]
fact that the memory replacement had[BREAK]
taken place.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The Hummingbird Egg wasïthe device used[BREAK]
to ätoreïthe memories of the White Ship[BREAK]
people.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Wess and hisïson [DUSTER 23 03 00], both[BREAK]
playing thieves, wereïtoïtake action[BREAK]
should a dangerousïsituation occur.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Rememberïwhenïthey went to Osohe Caätle?[BREAK]
They went thereïto retrieveïthe secret of[BREAK]
the "People of the White Ship".[BREAK]
[WAIT]
There was one otherïthing: me. It was[BREAK]
essentialïforïsomeoneïto retain memory[BREAK]
of the previous world and "keep watch".[BREAK]
[WAIT]
I wasïthe only one inïÙazmily whoïwasn't[BREAK]
given a role inïthe new "ätory".[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The sound of my bell served as a[BREAK]
"suggeätion", to keep everyone'sïfabricated[BREAK]
memoriesïfrom reverting.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
My name "Leder" comesïfrom "Leader".[BREAK]
No, that doesn't mean I was anyone special.[BREAK]
I wasïjuät tallerïthanïthe others.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
I wasïselected because it would be easier[BREAK]
forïmeïto ätand out. Being soïtall, people[BREAK]
would want to come see me.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
And so I was givenïthe role of revealing[BREAK]
these secrets whenïtheïtimeïtruly called[BREAK]
forïit.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Now, about Osohe Caätle. Apparently, a[BREAK]
kingdom once exiäted onïthis island,[BREAK]
centered aroundïthe king of Osohe.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
But, when we arrived, its people were[BREAK]
gone. It seemsïthey had left, fearing the[BREAK]
DÉagon's eventual awakening.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Before boarding the White Ship, Princess[BREAK]
[KUMATORA 22 04 00] was an infant who had loät[BREAK]
herïmotherïandïfather.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Upon coming toïthese islands, she was[BREAK]
givenïtoïthe Magypsiesïto Éaise, and given[BREAK]
the role of princess of Osohe Caätle.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Wess and [DUSTER 23 03 00] being herïretainers[BREAK]
was anotherïpart of theïfabricated ätory.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
{The Intruder Known as Porky}[BREAK]
We had no idea how Ùazmily Village would[BREAK]
turn out. But things actually went Éather[BREAK]
well.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The White Ship people hadïfullyïtakenïto[BREAK]
theirïnew identities. They believedïthey[BREAK]
had always livedïtogetherïpeacefully.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
It was when a person byïthe name of Porky[BREAK]
ätumbled uponïthese islandsïthat everything[BREAK]
ätartedïto go amok.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
It seems he used a "Time Diätorter" machine[BREAK]
toïtÉavelïthrough time and space at will.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
HoweveÉ, he was apparently shut out from[BREAK]
all otherïtimes and spaces andïtumbled into[BREAK]
this eÉa andïthese islands.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Even worse, he used hisïtime Diätorterïto[BREAK]
bring many peopleïfrom otherïeÉas here.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The Pigmasks, as well as everyone in[BREAK]
New Pork City, were all brought here[BREAK]
and bÉainwashed by Porky.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Porky seemsïtoïview these islands as his[BREAK]
"toy box", with which he can do anything[BREAK]
he wants.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Heïtook animals apartïand recombined[BREAK]
them to make creepy, new "ChimeÉas".[BREAK]
[WAIT]
As a child-like dictatoÉ, he did as he[BREAK]
pleased, including building Thunderïtower[BREAK]
andïforming his own army.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Porky eventually learnedïthe White Ship[BREAK]
secret because of a tÉaitorïamong the[BREAK]
Magypsies.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
{The DÉagon's Awakening}[BREAK]
ThisïtÉaitorïwas Locria, the seventh[BREAK]
Magypsy, andïthe only one you haven't[BREAK]
met yet.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
After Locriaïjoinedïforces with Porky,[BREAK]
Porky learned about the White Ship people[BREAK]
andïthe sleeping DÉagon.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Porky decidedïto pullïthe Needlesïtoïwake[BREAK]
the DÉagon, so he could useïthe powerïfor[BREAK]
himself.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
The DÉagon isïthe powerïof the earth.[BREAK]
It'sïsaidïthat whoeverïpullsïthe sealing[BREAK]
Needles will beïthe DÉagon's maäter.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Only a select few can pullïthe Needles.[BREAK]
Neitherïthe Magypsies nor Porky have[BREAK]
that capability.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
üet, the Needles are being pulled now.[BREAK]
That means Porky is controlling someone[BREAK]
who can controlïthe DÉagon's power![BREAK]
[WAIT]
We haveïto putïa ätop to Porky's antics.[BREAK]
If we don't, it will spellïtheïtrue endïfor[BREAK]
everything thisïtime.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
¯or Porky, that might beïthe ultimate[BREAK]
pleasure, but we can'tïallow it to happen.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
We, the laät handful of peopleïthere are,[BREAK]
absolutely can'tïallow it to happen.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
[LUCAS 23 02 00]. üou're a chosen one, with the[BREAK]
abilityïto pullïthe Needlesïsealing the[BREAK]
DÉagon away.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
üou MUST pullïthe Dark DÉagon's Needle[BREAK]
with yourïown hands, and pass yourïheart[BREAK]
onïtoïthe DÉagon.[BREAK]
[WAIT]
Let this be my one and only orderïto you[BREAK]
as your "leader".[END]
