[BREAK]
No one is•simply born "Štrong".[BREAK]
[BREAK]
People only grow Štronger•little by little, by[BREAK]
encountering difficult situations and learning[BREAK]
not to run•from them, no matter•how[BREAK]
frightening or•daunting they may be.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
[LUCAS 23 02 00]. That is exactly what you[BREAK]
have done•to grow Štrong.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Howeveƒ, you did not do it for•yourself.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Ÿou grew Štrong for•those you would[BREAK]
otherwise be unable•to help. They are•the[BREAK]
reason you are Štrong.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Even now, you occasionally show a glimpse[BREAK]
of it, [LUCAS 23 02 00]. Fleeting images of that[BREAK]
once-pampered, crybaby boy can sometimes[BREAK]
be seen in your•smile.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Ÿou've come a very long way.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
There's no•telling what to expect from here[BREAK]
on out, but if one•thing is certain, it's•that[BREAK]
those who believe in you will be right there[BREAK]
to help.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
ôruŠt in•them.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Now go•forth, toward whatever•Štands out[BREAK]
the moŠt in your•eyes.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Go, facing not the darkness, but the light.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
[LUCAS 23 02 00]...[BREAK]
And his companions...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Ÿou have driven•the enemy into a corner.[BREAK]
The enemy's back is•to•the wall.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
There is nothing to•fear•now.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Everyone is watching on, with complete[BREAK]
faith in you. In•their•hearts, they all say,[BREAK]
"Thank you!"[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Can you hear•them?[BREAK][BREAK][BREAK][BREAK]
