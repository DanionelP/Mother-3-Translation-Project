Firät, know this.[BREAK]
These are specially-protected islands.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
We reside uponïthese islandsïtogetherïwith[BREAK]
a limitless power.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
That powerïisïthe DÉagonïthat sleeps inïthe[BREAK]
darkness underïthe islands.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
The DÉagon is incredibly large. Aboutïas[BREAK]
large as allïthese islands put together.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Becauseïthe DÉagon is asleep, these islands[BREAK]
are protectedïfrom disaäter.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
But its powerïisïtoo great forïhumansïto[BREAK]
control.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
It wasïforïthis reasonïthat ourïancient[BREAK]
Magypsy anceätors placed seven "Needles"[BREAK]
inïthe DÉagonïto make it sleep.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
One Needleïforïeach Magypsy.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
¯orïa very, very long time, we have[BREAK]
continuedïto guardïthe Needles.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
But it has beenïtoldïthat someoneïtoïwake[BREAK]
the DÉagon will appearïwhen its powerïis[BREAK]
needed...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
HoweveÉ, if the one who needsïthe DÉagon's[BREAK]
powerïhas a heart ofïevil, that powerïwill[BREAK]
obey allïthat is evil. It'sïvery possibleïthat[BREAK]
everything could be completely deätroyed[BREAK]
simplyïto satiäfy wicked ambition.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Onïthe otherïhand, the exact opposite is[BREAK]
what we hopeïfor. If a person with a heart[BREAK]
of good pullsïthe DÉagon's Needles and uses[BREAK]
its poweÉ, theïfate of all evil will be washed[BREAK]
away, and all life as we know it will shine[BREAK]
brightly.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
That is what isïtold.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Finally, liätenïtoïthis, but don't worry.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
When each of ourïseven Needles is pulled,[BREAK]
we Magypsies will ceaseïto be, our[BREAK]
millennia-long lives over.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Isn't that juät romantic of us?[HEART][BREAK]
